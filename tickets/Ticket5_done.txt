%_HC_FATAL_EXCEPTION

This generic event is raised by the HC framework if the health check could not be executed correctly. This may have several reasons:
?HC runtime exceeded the configured maximum runtime
?A runtime exception was not caught
?A dump occurred

The framework will retry HC execution according to periodicilty settings. Usually encountered issues are only temporary and the the HC incident will be autoclosed after next successful run.

Only if the incident is open for more than a day, manual root cause analysis is required.
